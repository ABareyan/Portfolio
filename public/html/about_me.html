      <p class="size">I was born in 1979 in the capital of Armenia, Yerevan. As a child, I loved to play and participate
        in sports with my friends.</p>
        <p class="size">I started primary school in 1985, where I studied for 11 years. My favorite subject throughout the years was
        mathematics. After studying, I served in the Armenian army as a senior sergeant. After coming back from the
        military,
        I worked as a waiter in a bar. After some time had passed, I started to work as a coordinator in a public
        organization that specialized in the protection of rights for car drivers. During this time, I also began to
        learn 3D modeling
        for jewelry and worked in this specialty for almost a year. After a year had passed, I received an offer from
        one of the biggest automotive industries (Toyota) and accepted it with great pride and accomplishment as I loved
        the automotive
        industry. I would go on to work there for 10 years. I have learned to speak three languages throughout the
        course of my life (Armenian, Russian, and English). In 2005, I married, I have two children, a son, and a daughter.</p>
         <p class="size">In 2017, I made the decision to search for more opportunity for my family and myself,
        and thus my family and I moved to the USA. After searching and researching new career opportunities and choices,
        I took
        a keen interest in web development and design. It became very fascinating to edit and explore the possiblities
        of web development and computer coding. I am currently a student learning web development but I have
        independently created
        projects to test my abilities. Those projects and other developments can be seen in my portfolio tab. </p>
        <p class="size">Thank You!</p>
