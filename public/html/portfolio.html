        <p>Too many job seekers Butâ€¦ There is not a single platform where employees search for the jobs and employers
          post what they are looking for</p>
        <p>Building a middle ground between people who are actively looking for jobs and employers who are having
          difficulties finding competitive employee</p>
        <p>Job seekers look into our database to see available positions and compensation. If the type of job and
          compensation they are looking for matches with employers need, we will display the available jobs If they
          canâ€™t find the type of jobs, they can post themselves what type of jobs they are looking for and anticipated
          compensation</p>
        <p>Employers can directly post what type of employees they are hiring If thereâ€™s already profile set by the job
          seekers, employer can contact them</p>
